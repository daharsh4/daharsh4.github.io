Whether it is a data conversation or an unconventional real estate project, I wake up to be an *influential decision maker* on the teams I work on. My creative, collaborative, and decisive approach to solving complex problems follows me wherever I go. Four years ago, I invested in my first townhouse in Alexandria. With the many challenges that home ownership offers, I overcame them with the help of the internet and through collaborating with a few peers and even some strangers. Working with tenants is very similar to the daily work I face at Microsoft - I need to filter through a lot of "noise" to seek to understand the root of the problem/concern before offering a solution. I am now actively involved in four properties (1 Alexandria townhouse, 1 Arlington SFH, and the construction of 2 duplexes in DC). Navigating the unchartered territory of fixing a broken pipe, replacing several appliances/garage doors, establishing rental agreements, forming an LLC, and preparing taxes have required me to rapidly learn and delegate tasks to several friends/strangers. As a brief aside, I leveraged many of these same skills when training for and successfully completing a summit of Mount Rainer during a blizzard in 2018.

I also love meeting and learning from new people. I love the Mr. Rogers quote - *"there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story."* For the last five years I have had the unique opportunity to lead a team of volunteers as we mentor students from TC Williams High School. While not always easy, the work we get to do is always rewarding. A few highlights of my time at TC Williams include taking a 15 passenger bus down to Fredericksburg to introduce a group high school guys to Cookout, several runs to the Costco food court, and leading a 65 person camp trip up to New York.  

I do not want to just meet new people, I also want to use the gifts/platform I have been given to give a voice to those unheard around me. I really resonate with Bryan Stevenson's book Just Mercy, especially as he talked about the importance of opening our mouth for the mute. This is something I will strive to do for the rest of my life whether it is finding ways to support an underappreciated co-worker or taking several hundred more kids to camp... once COVID is over:)

In a previous life (10 years ago) I worked with a 5-person team to form a LLC called [PureMadi](https://www.puremadi.org) (madi translates to "water") to build a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. I document my experience in [http://daharsh4.blogspot.com/](http://daharsh4.blogspot.com/). Our team (was separately funded from a Jefferson Public Citizen grant) worked to receive a $40K "Deepening Global Education" grant to build the factory and worked with a civil engineering professor that had a $300k grant from NIH to identify the appropriate ratio of silver nanoparticles to clay. This type of work was particularly rewarding because it showed me at a young age how technology can be used to improve the lives of so many people.
