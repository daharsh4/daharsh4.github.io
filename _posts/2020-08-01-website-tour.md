![Website Links](https://daharsh4.github.io/assets/img/bannerpic.png)

The following links give a good snapshot into some of the things I have been up to over the last few years. 

## Building
   [Power App Governance for Federal Gov](https://aka.ms/powergov)
   Navigate to this link to see several resources that I have made available for customers looking to learn more about governance best practices for Power Apps. In this library of resources, you will be able to navigate to a few interviews that I conducted with National Park Service and Center for Disease Control to help them tell their story.

  [It Investment Tracker](https://aka.ms/itinvestment)
  Navigate to this link to see a report that I built for using OMB data from itdashboard.gov. This is a publicly available Power BI IT Investment report that can be shared with any CIO interested in seeing how Power BI can be used to help them track/compare their spending.

## Evangelizing
 [MicroStrategy World](https://aka.ms/dharshmstrworld) and [Strata Data](https://aka.ms/dharshstrata) conferences were two conferences that I spoke at when working for MicroStrategy as their Big Data Product Manager. My session from MicroStrategy World 2017 on the Hadoop Gateway is a must watch. I describe the validation process we took to release the Big Data Engine (aka the Hadoop Gateway). I present about several successful customer engagements. 
    
 [Linux Foundation](https://aka.ms/dharshlinux) was an article published in November of 2019 by the Linux Foundation. Based on some of the work I have been doing over the last couple of years, I was invited to represent Microsoft in this whitepaper that highlights how various BI tools can use AI. Navigate to page 4 to see the beginning of my section.
     
 [Gold Club FY20](https://aka.ms/dharshgold) highlights some of my specific accomplishments for FY20. 
**Note:** You will only be able to navigate to the Gold Club link with a FTE Microsoft account.
