Wether it is a data conversation or an unconvetional real estate project, I wake up to be an *influential decision maker* on the teams I work on. I like being in the role where I have the ability to call the shots and delegate tasks to a wide range of team members. Four years ago, as an extracurricular hobby, I invested in my first townhouse in Alexandria. Going into more debt than a med school student, I was thrilled to be in a position to live for free and rent to several friends.

I am now actively involved in four properites (1 Alexandria townhouse, 1 Arlington SFH, and the construction of 2 duplexes in DC). Navigating the unchartered territory of fixing a broken pipe, replacing several appliances/garage door, establishing rental agreements, forming an LLC, and preparing taxes have required me to rapidly learn and delegate tasks to several friends/strangers. As a breif aside, I leveraged many of these same skills when training for and successfully completing a summit of Mount Rainer during a blizzard in 2018.

I also love meeting new people and believe I can learn something new from all of them. I love the Mr. Rogers quote - *"there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story."* For the last five years I have had the unique opportunity to lead a team of volunteers as we mentor students from TC Williams High School (same school from Remember the Titans and largest high school in the state of Virginia). A few highlights of my time at TC Williams include taking a 15 passenger bus down to Fredricksburg to introduce a group high school guys to Cookout, several runs to the costco food court, and leading a 65 person camp trip up to New York.  As a leader, I have found ways to delegate responsibility, especially during the busier seasons of work.

I really resonated with Bryan Stevenson's book, Just Mercy, as he talked about the importance of opening our mouth for the mute. This is something I will strive to do for the rest of my life whether it is finding ways to support a underappreciated co-worker or taking several hundred more kids to camp... once COVID is over:)
