I believe my career has shown I exhibit a strong potential to excel as a Data & AI SSP. I hope to address many questions that may come up as I apply to this new role. 

## Why do I want a role change? 
Growing comfortable in a technical role at Microsoft might be a dream for some but makes me feel a tad bit underutilized and restless.  I believe I can make a stronger business impact in a Data & AI SSP role, driving data strategy conversations and more importantly building long-lasting relationships with business decision makers that go far beyond a specific technical engagement. 

## Why am I a good fit?
As it becomes more and more imperative to win the data estate of customers, Scott Guthrie highlighted how this new type of sale is deeply technical. I believe I pose the necessary combination of business acumen with the technical depth that will be required to go far in this role. I was able to easily pass DP-200, DP-201 (Azure Data Engineer), AI-100 (Azure AI Engineer), DA-100 (Power BI), AZ-900(Azure Fundamentals) , MS-900 (M365 Fundamentals) and have spent an extensive amount of time as a product manager leading teams of engineers to deliver a Big Data Engine at MicroStrategy. 

### What experience do you have hunting and driving technical engagements in a territory?
- For the last 7 years, I have been in roles working with some of the largest customers in the world to drive successful engagements on some of their largest data workloads.
	• 2014 - My Big Data journey began in 2014, when I was the first consultant to successfully stand up a BI connection to Presto at Netflix.
	 
	I led an 8-week technology pilot project to introduce a new analytical engine to Facebook (to replace Vertica) working along side the Data Engineering Director of Facebook (Guy Bayes) ultimately sending several emails to the CIO (Tim Campos) to report our successful project. Success of pilot led to several million dollars in additional MicroStrategy licenses. 
	• 2015 - I was responsible for identifying and managing several strategic accounts that would participate as "Early Adopters" of the new release of our Platform. First, I had to work with our internal account teams to convince them that our engagement would lead to a net positive experience for them. Second, set clear expectations with the customer. And third, delivered results to several executive audience members. 
	Led solo pilot engagements to showcase new platform features to 15 customers in 7 countries
