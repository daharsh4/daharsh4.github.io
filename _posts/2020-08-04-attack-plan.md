If I were to transition roles into a Data and AI SSP, these are some of the things I would look to accomplish during my first 6 months.

## Establish rapport with internal account team
  From an Internal Perspective
ACR ACR ACR. AE, ATS, 
Enlist the support of my peers. Show them how these workloads are a lot stickier ; Gaining a data workload is going to be stickier than 
We find these workloads are stickier than 
- PowerBI Premium - 3,700 ACR
WOrk with other Data and AI peers to better understand the repeatable motions that have worked well. 

## Customer engagement
Helping people tell their story 
- Consolidating user communities (organizing a champions call to let early adopters discuss their progress (timing and audience very important)  ) 

## Be a consumate learner
In additional to several key personal relationships that I would look to foster and grow, I would also realize I need to spend a time better familiarizing myself with our Azure Data 

From an Individual Perspective 
-> internal certifications
-> msx opps (engage with opp owners where possible)
-> department of energy research 


## Leverage Career Experience 
What experience do I have with research labs?
- Board of national medical examiners - MicroStrategy 
- NIH - NHLBI, NCATS, NCI, CIT - Microsoft
- A lot of the funding patterns are very decentralized. Collaboration and a stick-to-it-ive approach to a sales cycle will be critical to success
- Career scientists and researchers are skeptical of sales. Deep technical prowess combined with establishing rapport early/often is important to winning their trust 

Why would it be a dream to work for the Department of Energy?
From what I know about the Department of Energy, it would be a dream to drive their data & AI strategy. The advanced research these labs are looking to perform would stretch the bounds of Azure to new frontiers. I also believe some of the relationships I would form in these different offices could postively impact the work I am looking to more actively engage in in several developing countries. 

In a previous life, 10 years ago, I worked with a 5-person team to form a LLC called [PureMadi](https://www.puremadi.org) (madi translates to "water") to build a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. I document my experience in [http://daharsh4.blogspot.com/] (http://daharsh4.blogspot.com/). Our team (was seperately funded from a Jefferson Public Citizen grant) worked to recieve a $40K "Deepeding Global Education" grant to build the factory and worked with a civil engineering professor that had a $300k grant from NIH to identify the appropriate ratio of silver nanoparticles to clay. This type of work was particularly rewarding because it showed me at a young age how technology can be used to improve the lives of so many people.
