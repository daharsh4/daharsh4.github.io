Hypothetical Plan of Attack (first 90 days)

What experience do I have with research labs?
- Board of national medical examiners 
- NIH 
- Pureists; everywhere from addressing them as "doctor" etc.; hunting after the agencies that have access to grant funding (firehouse) 
- Decentralized; empowering the mission units that they can make the decision; 


Why would it be a dream to work for the Department of Energy?
Advanced data research; renewable energy is something that is life changing. For the first time my passion for the third world and technology could become coupled. 


What ideas do you have for FY21? 

From a customer engagement perspective - 
Helping people tell their story 
- Consolidating user communities (organizing a champions call to let early adopters discuss their progress (timing and audience very important)  ) 

From an Internal Perspective
ACR ACR ACR. AE, ATS, 
Enlist the support of my peers. Show them how these workloads are a lot stickier ; Gaining a data workload is going to be stickier than 
We find these workloads are stickier than 
- PowerBI Premium - 3,700 ACR

From an Individual Perspective 
-> internal certifications
-> msx opps (engage with opp owners where possible)
-> department of energy research 


This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
