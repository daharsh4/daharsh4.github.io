If I were to transition roles into a Data and AI Specialist, these are some of the things I would look to accomplish during my first 3 months. 

# Month 1 (First 30 days)
## Establish rapport with internal account team
From my first three years here at Microsoft, I know how critical it is to establish strong relationships with peers that I am working alongside every day. This always helps to magnify my impact. Knowing how much of a focus area ACR is for AEs, ATSs, and many other internal account resources, I will work to showcase how the work I am doing will drive ACR and lead to data workloads that are a lot stickier than other workloads. I also will make sure I work alongside my fellow Data & AI peers to better understand the repeatable motions that have worked well in the industry space. Maybe more importantly, I will need to identify the various existing MSX sales motions (and their owners) we have in the pipeline to make sure these are properly driven. I will also set-up breif introduction calls to various CSAs that will be working in accounts to better understand their backgrounds/skillsets. This will be important when working to drive results with customers. 

That said, some of the best relationship building I can do will be to show people I can carry my weight and deliver results (with the help of others). This is not something I will take lightly as I realize how many people are dependent on me to reach and significantly exceed their quota. 

## Be a consummate learner
In addition to several key personal relationships that I would look to foster and grow, I also realize I am a stronger seller when I focus on staying in front of the messaging of our senior product managers and general managers. Listening to various internal and external presentations will be important for this. On top of this I know I will benefit from having the **DP-200**, **DP-201**, and **AI-100** certifications complete but will be eager to find new ways to learn to improve my ability to sell in this deeply technical role.

## Customer engagement
As I quickly ramp up in several other areas, I know that I cannot sell anything, if I don't meet with and build relationships with the customer. I will look to quickly introduce myself (or be introduced) to several key stakeholders on the customer side and *seek to understand their problems before being understood. * As these relationships grow, I hope I can get to a point where I can begin to introduce several of my customer relationships to each other. I have found whenever working with decentralized organizations some of the best "selling" you can do is simply making connections within the organization. NIH and DOI have both benefited from monthly centralized calls that I have organized to discuss the progress of various technical engagements I have running with them. Timing and audience are very important on these calls. 

## Forecasting and Pipeline management
I will immeditaely benefit from the work I already do in MSX. Documenting technical engagements/milestones/opportunities can often be overlooked by a sales organization that seeks to prioritize being in the field. However, I know that the more I document about the progress of the individual work I am doing, the more opportunity I have for a peer or senior leader to help me. From my experience, I understand some customers (and internal team members) like to "oversell" opportunities so that they might get more attention. As I am figuring out which opportunities to drive, it will be important to learn from my peers which customers (and team members) have this tendency as to improve my time management with customers. 

# Month 2 (First 60 days)
## Be a consumate teacher 
While I have a lot to learn, there is also a mountain of topics I can help teach my peers. The full value of Microsoft platform is greater than the sum of all of it's parts. My experience selling cross-cloud technologies (Modern Workplace, the Power Platform, and Dynamics) will drive value to any data opportunities across our account space. I understand that many executives will better resonate with our data story when they see the intuitive way the Power Platform presents this information. 

I worked to build a Power Platform + Azure Cognitive Services for the FDA and their International Mailing Facilities to help track counterfeit drugs. This solution has been repurposed across many of our accounts and I was invited to present about this to several colleagues during our FY20 Federal Academy in May. (with internal MSFT account login, navigate to 35:00-49:00 to see my [presentation and demo](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/d330a4ff-0400-96d1-8006-f1ea8bd89ea8).

At the beginning part of FY21, I worked with a couple senior leaders in our Federal CSU to identify knowledge gaps in their team. Together we formed a Fed Business Intelligence Academy that several parts of our organization are benefitting from. I was invited to promote this Academy at our (all-up) Fed Academy in October. This presentation can be found [here at 1:29:00](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/4ad4a3ff-0400-9fb2-8d76-f1eb1256de92) and Teams Wiki page can be found [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A8870b6639f784d6e9f9e38bfa66fbbe5%40thread.skype/tab%3A%3A2e467fe1-ae35-4062-8cb7-2b5774389db0?groupId=eabdd334-79a8-4b9e-9309-6d17d0d7edb1&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47). The presentation was one of the top rated sessions in the Fed Academy hosted on October 19th, 2020. 

## Use reporting & analytics to drive data conversations
Being one of the Power BI thought leaders in our Federal space, I have worked with several Data & AI Specialists to "seed" data stories with customers that are struggling to realize the value of moderninzing their data estate. 
 I am currently working on a key initiative with the Finance Director at DoI responsible for their entire Financial Business Management System (FBMS). The work I am doing, started with Power BI, but has become a very big opportunity for us to migrate their financial reporting system from SAP to Azure. 

I am also working with the engineering team from the US Postal Service to use Power BI to track their machine upgrades by location. After showing them how the data could be displayed and socialized in Power BI, they were convinced they wanted to rearchitect their back-end data process. This has led to another opportunity for our Data & AI team that I have been able to drive. 

## Establish business priorities alongside key influencers 
Over the last 7 years, I have successfully built relationships with many executive leaders in my account spaces. From Tim Campos (CIO) at Facebook to Dan Morgan (CDO) at Department of Transportation, it has been very beneficially to keep these senior leaders engaged and involved in the work that I am doing in their accounts. Through email updates, and frequent meetigns, I am better able to steer the direction of our projects that we hope to accomplish. Navigating these relationships is not always easy but definitely worth it.

# Month 3 (First 90 days)
## Be a consumate evangelist 
After closing a large deal, it will be critical to tell the story to achieve even more future success. I have seen this several times in my career already. On one of my visits with Carrefour, I spent several weeks working with their senior leaders to design and establish a Lambda Architecture that would help them extract real-time information from Kafka while batch processing some of their largest datasets in HDFS. This engagement led to Carrefour deploying our Hadoop Gateway and buying $750K of additional compute capacity for their MicroStrategy Intelligence Server. I was subsequently invited to speak at the 2017 New York Strata Data conference with Cloudera. [https://aka.ms/dharshstrata](https://aka.ms/dharshstrata)

[Linux Foundation](https://aka.ms/dharshlinux) was an article published in November of 2019 by the Linux Foundation. Based on some of the work I have been doing over the last couple of years, I was invited to represent Microsoft in this whitepaper that highlights how various BI tools can use AI. Navigate to page 4 to see the beginning of my section.

As a Data & AI Specialist, I will work with our marketing team to tell these stories so that I can continue to build pipeline for future deals.

## Refine Customer Narative 
Sharing key account wins (internally and externally) and leveraging partners will allow me to scale my impact. Before ever thinking about scalability, I also understand how important it will be to always work to refine my messaging to customers. I will be able to accomplish this through joining key industry events, familiarize myself with key updates in the news, and continuing to learn from my peers. I have also found focusing during Account planning meetings to refine my messaging can help to drive this short-term and long-term success with customers.
