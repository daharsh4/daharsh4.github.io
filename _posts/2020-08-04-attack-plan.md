If I were to transition roles into a Data and AI SSP, these are some of the things I would look to accomplish during my first 6 months.

## Establish rapport with internal account team
From my first three years here at Microsoft, I know how critical it is to establish strong relationships with peers that you are working alongside every day. This will help to magnify my impact (and selfishly make Microsoft an enjoyable place to work). Knowing how much of a focus area ACR is for my AEs, ATSs, and many other internal account resources, I will work to showcase how the work I am doing will drive ACR and lead to data workloads that are a lot stickier than other workloads. I also recognize GCC and GCC High further complicate sales motions and will make sure I work alongside my fellow Data & AI peers to better understand the repeatable motions that have worked well in the government space. Maybe most importantly, I will need to identify the various existing MSX sales motions (and their owners) we have in the pipeline to make sure these are properly driven. 

That said, some of the best relationship building I can do will be to show people I can carry my weight and deliver results. This is not something I will take lightly as I realize how many people are dependent on me to reach and significantly exceed their quota. 

## Be a consummate learner
In addition to several key personal relationships that I would look to foster and grow, I also realize I am a stronger seller when I focus on staying in front of the messaging of our senior product managers and general managers. Listening to various internal and external presentations will be important for this.

On top of this I know I will benefit from having the **DP-200**, **DP-201**, and **AI-100** certifications complete.

I will also begin to subscribe to and track several DoE and Federal Blogs to make sure I am staying ahead of the news. 

## Customer engagement
As I quickly ramp up in several other areas, I know that I cannot sell anything, if I don't meet with and build relationships with the customer. I will look to quickly introduce myself (or be introduced) to several key stakeholders on the customer side and *seek to understand their problems before being understood. *

As these relationships grow, I hope I can get to a point where I can begin to introduce several of my customer relationships to each other. I have found whenever working with decentralized organizations some of the best "selling" you can do is simply making connections within the organization. NIH and DOI have both benefited from monthly centralized calls that I have looked to organize to discuss the progress of various technical engagements I have running with them. For these calls, I know that the timing and audience will be very important. 

## Leverage Career Experience 
What experience do I have with research labs?
- Board of national medical examiners - MicroStrategy 
- NIH - NHLBI, NCATS, NCI, CIT - Microsoft
- A lot of the funding patterns are very decentralized. Collaboration and a stick-to-it-ive approach to a sales cycle will be critical to success
- Career scientists and researchers are skeptical of sales. Deep technical prowess combined with establishing rapport early/often is important to winning their trust 

Why would it be a dream to work for the Department of Energy?
From what I know about the Department of Energy, it would be a dream to drive their data & AI strategy. The advanced research these labs are looking to perform would stretch the bounds of Azure to new frontiers. I also believe some of the relationships I would form in these different offices could postively impact the work I am looking to more actively engage in in several developing countries. 

In a previous life, 10 years ago, I worked with a 5-person team to form a LLC called [PureMadi](https://www.puremadi.org) (madi translates to "water") to build a ceramic water filter factory in South Africa. I document my experience in [http://daharsh4.blogspot.com/](http://daharsh4.blogspot.com/). Our team (was separately funded from a Jefferson Public Citizen grant) worked to receive a $40K "Deepening Global Education" grant to build the factory and worked with a civil engineering professor that had a $300k grant from NIH to identify the appropriate ratio of silver nanoparticles to clay. This type of work was particularly rewarding because it showed me at a young age how technology can be used to improve the lives of so many people.
