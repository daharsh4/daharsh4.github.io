I believe my career has shown I exhibit a strong potential to excel as a Data and AI SSP. I hope to address many questions that may come up as I apply to this new role. 

## Why do I want a role change? 
Growing comfortable in a technical role at Microsoft might be a dream for some but makes me feel a tad bit underutilized and restless.  I believe I can make a stronger business impact in a Data & AI SSP role, driving data strategy conversations and more importantly building long-lasting relationships with business decision makers that go far beyond a specific technical engagement. 

## Why am I a good fit?
"Winning the data estate of customers is deeply technical." -Scott Guthrie.  I believe I pose the necessary combination of business acumen with the technical depth that will be required to go far in this role. I was able to easily pass DP-200, DP-201 (Azure Data Engineer), AI-100 (Azure AI Engineer), DA-100 (Power BI), AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) , MS-900 (M365 Fundamentals) and have spent an extensive amount of time as a product manager leading teams of engineers to deliver a Big Data Engine at MicroStrategy. 

## What experience do you have hunting and driving technical engagements in a territory?
For the last 7 years, I have been in roles working with some of the largest customers in the world to drive successful engagements on some of their largest data workloads.

- 2014 - I led an 8-week technology pilot project to introduce a new analytical engine to Facebook (to replace Vertica) working along side the Data Engineering Director at Facebook (Guy Bayes) ultimately sending several emails to the CIO (Tim Campos) to report our successful project. Success of pilot led to several million dollars in additional MicroStrategy licenses. 

- 2015 - I was responsible for identifying and managing several strategic accounts that would participate as "Early Adopters" of the new release of our Platform. First, I had to work with our internal account teams to convince them that our engagement would lead to a net positive experience for them. Second, set clear expectations with the customer. And third, deliver results to several executive audience members. This resulted in solo pilot engagements to showcase our new platform features to 15 customers in 7 countries in 18 months. (USA: Facebook, Netflix, NBME, BMC, Freddie Mac; France: Carrefour; Canada: Loblaws, Toronto Transit Commission; Germany: Zalando, ThyssenKrupp, Xing; Isreal: Redbend, LivePerson; Latvia: Visma; Argentina: Sistemas Globales)

- 2016 -  I then worked to release and validate our Big Data Engine to customers looking to perform self-service analytics on their largest datasets. Testing our BDE on Terabytes of data at NBC Universal and navigating several security obstacles with Citi (SSL and MIT Kerberos) ensured our Hadoop Gateway (Big Data Engine) was ready for the market. This year focused on helping lead advanced data analytics sales motions with 6 of MicroStrategies largest customers. (Citi, Carrefour, NBC Universal, eBay, AMEX, Freddie Mac)

- 2017 - After successfully testing the Hadoop Gateway at several customers, I submitted several proposals to promote this new technology. After my presentation at our annual MicroStrategy World conference [https://aka.ms/dharshmstrworld](https://aka.ms/dharshmstrworld), I was invited to speak at the 2017 New York Strata Data conference with Cloudera. [https://aka.ms/dharshstrata](https://aka.ms/dharshstrata) Not only was it important to individually deliver results at every customer I engage with, I found that telling the story at these large conferences led to a substantial uptick in product adoption and growth. 

- 2018 - In my first few months of joining Microsoft, I developed several key internal and external relationships that have helped to amplify my work for the last couple of years. Developing several strong key relationships within the ATU helped me to establish Power BI as a key component of our Enterprise strategies. My work with partners (SolidQ, Pragmatic Works, Accenture Federal Services) to secure ECIF in a few of my deals have helped to drive adoption. 

- 2019 - Despite being introduced to a new technology stack (Power Apps and Power Automate) where I had very limited career experience, I was responsible for developing the ATU Power Platform strategy for 8 of our 11 Fed Civilian Strategic accounts during the banner FY19 year. Identifying gaps in what we were delivering to customers and then working with a few GBBs showcased how I can drive value even when unfamiliar with the technology.
