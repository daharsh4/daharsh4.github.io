My career has shown I exhibit a strong potential to excel as an SSP. I hope to address many questions that may come up as I apply to this new role. 

## Why a role change would benefit Microsoft 
I am most utilized when working with business decision makers to solve some of their most difficult problems. For the last 7 years, I have been working with some of the largest companies in the world to introduce new data technologies and know I can make a stronger business impact in an SSP role, driving data strategy conversations for Microsoft. 

## Why am I a good fit?
*"Winning the data estate of customers is deeply technical and is a new "room" in the house compared to the ones we typically sell to."* -Scott Guthrie. I possess the necessary combination of business experience, business acumen, and technical depth that will be required to go far in this role. Supporting nascent technologies, I have been operating as a "Power Platform SSP" for the last several years to great success. I have also passed DP-200, DP-201 (Azure Data Engineer), AI-100 (Azure AI Engineer), DA-100 (Power BI), AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) , MS-900 (M365 Fundamentals) and have spent an extensive amount of time as a product manager leading teams of engineers to deliver a Big Data Engine at MicroStrategy. The most successful SSPs will be those that are able to *hunt and lead strategy conversations internally on account teams/externally with customers* **AND** *drive deeply technical engagements.*

## By the numbers:

**FY19:** On a 6-person Technical Specialist Federal team, the accounts I covered in FY19 accounted for 23% of the Power BI revenue and 25% of the O365 E5 revenue. 

**FY20:** On an 8-person Power Platform Technical Specialist Federal team, the accounts I covered in FY20 accounted for 37% of the Power BI revenue and 39% of the Power Apps and Power Automate revenue, more than 2x anybody else on the team.


## What experience do you have developing, hunting, and leading data strategy conversations in a territory?

Whether in a technical product management role or a pre-sales solutions architect role, I have always been focused on driving an increase in sales. 

- **Netflix** - I was the first consultant to successfully visualize data from Presto with a Business Intelligence tool at Netflix by using a JDBC driver to extract the data from the source system. <<RESULT>>

**Facebook** - In 2015, I led an 8-week technology pilot project to introduce a new analytical engine to Facebook (to replace their need for Vertica) working alongside the Data Engineering Director at Facebook (Guy Bayes) ultimately sending several emails to the CIO (Tim Campos) to report our successful project. Success of pilot led to $6.5 million of MicroStrategy licenses (3.5M recurring and 3M new). 

**Early Adopter Program** - From 2015-2017, I was one of the lead beta consultants for the Early Adopter program at MicroStrategy, responsible for driving adoption of the latest versions of our software. Starting with a pipeline of our top 100 accounts, I sought to identify our top accounts that could most benefit by upgrading to the latest version of our MicroStrategy platform - pending license renewal and open for marketing stories. My work resulted in solo pilot engagements to showcase our new platform features to 15 customers of our largest 50 customers in 7 countries in 18 months. (USA: Facebook, Netflix, NBME, BMC, Freddie Mac; France: Carrefour; Canada: Loblaws, Toronto Transit Commission; Germany: Zalando, ThyssenKrupp, Xing; Isreal: Redbend, LivePerson; Latvia: Visma; Argentina: Sistemas Globales) After these engagements, we found that a customer was 35% more likely to renew and/or increase the amount they spent on MicroStrategy if they were using the latest versions of our platform.

**Big Data Validation Engagements /** **Carrefour**/**Strata** - In 2016/2017, I shifted my focus to take full responsibility of leading our Big Data Validation program. Testing our Big Data Engine on Terabytes of data at NBC Universal and navigating several security obstacles with Citi (SSL and MIT Kerberos) ensured our Hadoop Gateway (Big Data Engine) was ready for the market. Over the course of the year I helped lead advanced data analytics sales motions with 6 of MicroStrategy’s largest customers that each accounted for at least $4M/year. (Citi, Carrefour, NBC Universal, eBay, AMEX, Freddie Mac) For more details about this program refer to the [Hadoop Gateway Presentation](https://aka.ms/dharshmstrworld) that I gave at MicroStrategy World 2017. On one of my visits with Carrefour, I spent several weeks working with their senior leaders to design and establish a Lambda Architecture that would help them extract real-time information from Kafka while batch processing some of their largest datasets in HDFS. This engagement led to Carrefour deploying our Hadoop Gateway and buying $750K of additional compute capacity for their MicroStrategy Intelligence Server. I was subsequently invited to speak at the 2017 New York Strata Data conference with Cloudera. [https://aka.ms/dharshstrata](https://aka.ms/dharshstrata) By September 2017, 15 of our largest 30 customers had successfully deployed the Hadoop Data Gateway.

**Power BI success in FY19** - In my first few months of joining Microsoft, I developed several key internal and external relationships that have helped to amplify my work for the last couple of years. Developing several strong key relationships within the ATU helped me to establish Power BI as a key component of our Enterprise sales strategies leading to Power BI reaching 366% of our Federal target in FY19. 

**ECIF made easy** My work with partners (SolidQ, Pragmatic Works, Accenture Federal Services) to secure over $100,000 of ECIF in a few of my deals have helped to drive adoption. I used lessons learned from USDA ECIF with SolidQ to benefit other sellers. I worked with Paco Gonzalez, CEO of SOlidQ, to develop an elastic SOW that can be applied to any deal to help drive Power BI. Impact: Streamlined partner engagements for post-sales motions. 

**Effectively a Power Apps and Power Automate SSP for FY20:** As the Power Platform was released in GCC in FY20, there was very limited SSP coverage of this increasingly viral technology platform. I took charge of ATU strategy, demo, and licensing conversations for 8 of our 11 Federal Civilian Strategic accounts. My breadth of experience driving new technologies in customer conversations was immediately valuable. The Federal Biz Apps SSPs that I supported obtained 231% of their target in the federal business in FY20 and I was selected into FY20 Gold Club.

## Perspectives (not your typical TSP) 
*"DAVID IS AWESOME! He’s having meetings, driving business, and moving things forward – I love that! He’s having meetings and I didn’t even know they were happening – which is GREAT! It means he’s taking ownership and allowing me to scale on other things!"* ~MWP SSP, Fed Civ

*"Contagious enthusiasm about our products and what customers can do with them. Once an idea is established, you will see it through no matter how much work it takes."* Data & AI SSP, FHB ATU

*"There are very few TSPs that I can think of who are even close to having the seller mentality that you do. You sound excited and passionate about what you are selling which is so important. We need to show our belief in our products rather than just have a dry technical discussion. You are so good at bringing that fire to every customer interaction."* ~Data & AI SSP, Fed Civ

*"David...thanks for all the great work you are doing with our customers...I don’t think there is a customer in our space you haven’t worked with and when you do progress is always made.  Appreciate the creative thinking, enthusiasm, and passion for the business/work you are doing...it’s infectious.  You make it look effortless although we all know there is a lot of preparation and work that goes into this.  Thanks again for the support.  Nice job!!"* ATU Manager, Fed
