My career has shown I exhibit a strong potential to excel as a Data and AI SSP. I hope to address many questions that may come up as I apply to this new role. 

## Why a role change would benefit Microsoft 
I am most utilized when working with business decision makers to solve some of their most difficult problems. For the last 7 years, I have been working with some of the largest companies in the world to introduce new data technologies and know I can make a stronger business impact in a Data & AI SSP role, driving data strategy conversations for Microsoft. 

## Why am I a good fit?
*"Winning the data estate of customers is deeply technical and is a new "room" in the house compared to the ones we typically sell to."* -Scott Guthrie. I possess the necessary combination of business experience, business acumen, and technical depth that will be required to go far in this role. Supporting nascent technologies, I have been operating as a "Power Platform SSP" for the last several years to great success. I have also passed DP-200, DP-201 (Azure Data Engineer), AI-100 (Azure AI Engineer), DA-100 (Power BI), AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) , MS-900 (M365 Fundamentals) and have spent an extensive amount of time as a product manager leading teams of engineers to deliver a Big Data Engine at MicroStrategy. The most successful Data & AI SSPs will be those that are able to *hunt and lead strategy conversations internally on account teams/externally with customers* **AND** *drive deeply technical engagements.*

## By the numbers:

**FY19:** On a 6-person Technical Specialist Federal team, the accounts I covered in FY19 accounted for 23% of the Power BI revenue and 25% of the O365 E5 revenue. 

**FY20:** On an 8-person Power Platform Technical Specialist Federal team, the accounts I covered in FY20 accounted for 37% of the Power BI revenue and 39% of the Power Apps and Power Automate revenue, more than 2x anybody else on the team.


## What experience do you have developing, hunting, and leading data strategy conversations in a territory?

Whether in a technical product management role or a pre-sales solutions architect role, I have always been focused on driving an increase in sales. 

**Facebook** - In 2015, I led an 8-week technology pilot project to introduce a new analytical engine to Facebook (to replace their need for Vertica) working alongside the Data Engineering Director at Facebook (Guy Bayes) ultimately sending several emails to the CIO (Tim Campos) to report our successful project. Success of pilot led to $6.5 million of MicroStrategy licenses (3.5M recurring and 3M new). 

**Early Adopter Program** - From 2015-2017, I led the Early Adopter program at MicroStrategy. Starting with a list of our top 100 accounts, I sought to identify our top accounts that could most benefit by upgrading to the latest version of our MicroStrategy platform - pending license renewal and open for marketing stories. My work resulted in solo pilot engagements to showcase our new platform features to 15 customers of our largest 50 customers in 7 countries in 20 months. (USA: Facebook, Netflix, NBME, BMC, Freddie Mac; France: Carrefour; Canada: Loblaws, Toronto Transit Commission; Germany: Zalando, ThyssenKrupp, Xing; Isreal: Redbend, LivePerson; Latvia: Visma; Argentina: Sistemas Globales) After these engagements, we found that a customer was 35% more likely to renew and/or increase the amount they spent on MicroStraegy if they were on the latests version of the platform.

**Big Data Validation Engagements**  **Carrefour** - In 2016, I Lambda Architecture to explore using kafka with some of their largest datasets in HDFS. 750K

**High-impact presentations** to drive awareness, prevent competition, and encourage adoption. Presented at Farm Credit IT Symposium to audience of 30+ IT managers from various Farm Credits. (Impact: Farm Credit $129K of PBI and $151K E5 in FY19) Orchestrated PowerBI day at SBA to prevent Tableau from continuing to grow influence. Meeting will now be repeated quarterly, owned by SBA. (Impact: SBA $250K of PBI; $1.23M E5 in FY19) 

• ECIF made easy : Used lessons learned from USDA ECIF to benefit other sellers. Developed an elastic SOW with partner (SolidQ) that can be applied to any deal to help drive PowerBI. Impact: Streamlined partner engagements 

**Power Apps and Power Automate for FY20:** With less than The Federal Biz Apps SSPs that I supported obtained 231% of their target in the federal business in FY20. 

- **2018** - In my first few months of joining Microsoft, I developed several key internal and external relationships that have helped to amplify my work for the last couple of years. Developing several strong key relationships within the ATU helped me to establish Power BI as a key component of our Enterprise sales strategies leading to Power BI reaching 366% of target. My work with partners (SolidQ, Pragmatic Works, Accenture Federal Services) to secure over $100,000 of ECIF in a few of my deals have helped to drive adoption. 

- **2019** - Despite being introduced to a new technology stack (Power Apps and Power Automate) where I had very limited career experience, I was responsible for developing the ATU Power Platform strategy for 8 of our 11 Fed Civilian Strategic accounts during the banner FY20 year. Identifying gaps in what we were delivering to customers and then working with a few GBBs showcased how I can drive value even when unfamiliar with the technology. 



## What experience do you have driving technical engagements in a territory?
For the last 7 years, I have been in roles working with some of the largest customers in the world to drive successful engagements on some of their largest data workloads.

- **2014** - I was the first consultant to successfully visualize data from Presto with a Business Intelligence tool at Netflix by using a JDBC driver to extract the data from the source system. 

- **2015** - I was responsible for identifying and managing several strategic accounts that would participate as "Early Adopters" of the new release of our Platform. First, I had to work with our internal account teams to convince them that our engagement would lead to a net positive experience for them. Once convinced, I would then set clear expectations with the customer teams I would work with and make sure to inform key executive stakeholders of our progress/results. My work resulted in solo pilot engagements to showcase our new platform features to 15 customers in 7 countries in 18 months. (USA: Facebook, Netflix, NBME, BMC, Freddie Mac; France: Carrefour; Canada: Loblaws, Toronto Transit Commission; Germany: Zalando, ThyssenKrupp, Xing; Isreal: Redbend, LivePerson; Latvia: Visma; Argentina: Sistemas Globales)

- **2016** -  I worked to release and validate our Big Data Engine to customers looking to perform self-service analytics on their largest datasets in Hadoop. Testing our BDE on Terabytes of data at NBC Universal and navigating several security obstacles with Citi (SSL and MIT Kerberos) ensured our Hadoop Gateway (Big Data Engine) was ready for the market. Over the course of the year I helped lead advanced data analytics sales motions with 6 of MicroStrategy’s largest customers that each accounted for at least $4M/year. (Citi, Carrefour, NBC Universal, eBay, AMEX, Freddie Mac) 

- **2017** - After successfully testing the Hadoop Gateway at several customers, I submitted several proposals to promote this new technology. After my presentation at our annual MicroStrategy World conference [https://aka.ms/dharshmstrworld](https://aka.ms/dharshmstrworld), I was invited to speak at the 2017 New York Strata Data conference with Cloudera. [https://aka.ms/dharshstrata](https://aka.ms/dharshstrata) Not only was it important to individually deliver results for every customer, evangelizing this success at these conferences gave my peers and customers publicly available information that they could use to further drive successful sales engagements. By September 2017, 15 of our largest 30 customers had successfully deployed the Hadoop Data Gateway.


## Perspectives (not your typical TSP) 
*"DAVID IS AWESOME! He’s having meetings, driving business, and moving things forward – I love that! He’s having meetings and I didn’t even know they were happening – which is GREAT! It means he’s taking ownership and allowing me to scale on other things!"* ~MWP SSP, Fed Civ

*"Contagious enthusiasm about our products and what customers can do with them. Once an idea is established, you will see it through no matter how much work it takes."* Data & AI SSP, FHB ATU

*"There are very few TSPs that I can think of who are even close to having the seller mentality that you do. You sound excited and passionate about what you are selling which is so important. We need to show our belief in our products rather than just have a dry technical discussion. You are so good at bringing that fire to every customer interaction."* ~Data & AI SSP, Fed Civ

*"David...thanks for all the great work you are doing with our customers...I don’t think there is a customer in our space you haven’t worked with and when you do progress is always made.  Appreciate the creative thinking, enthusiasm, and passion for the business/work you are doing...it’s infectious.  You make it look effortless although we all know there is a lot of preparation and work that goes into this.  Thanks again for the support.  Nice job!!"* ATU Manager, Fed
