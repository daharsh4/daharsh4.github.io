### Why do I want a role change? 
Growing comfortable in a technical role at Microsoft might be a dream for some but makes me feel a tad bit underutilized and restless.  I believe I can make a stronger business impact in a Data & AI SSP role, driving data strategy conversations and more importantly building long-lasting relationships with business decision makers that go far beyond a specific technical engagement. 

### Why am I a good fit?
As it becomes more and more imperative to win the data estate of customers, 
Technical hunters. Only hunters won't be as productiveâ€¦ deeply technical.. AI-100, AZ-900; DP-200; coasted through these exams. 
DA-100, MS-900, PowerBI 70-779 as technical requirements.. 

In a recent Ready session - Scott Guthrie called out how important it will be to win the data estate of a customer.
